Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS SDK for Python
========================================

The PAN-OS SDK for Python (pan-os-python) is a package to help interact with
Palo Alto Networks devices (including physical and virtualized Next-generation
Firewalls and Panorama).  The pan-os-python SDK is object oriented and mimics
the traditional interaction with the device via the GUI or CLI/API.

Status
------

Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS SDK for Python is considered stable. It is fully tested
and used in many production environments. Semantic versioning is applied to indicate
bug fixes, new features, and breaking changes in each version.

Install
-------

Install using pip:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install pan-os-python

Upgrade to the latest version:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install --upgrade pan-os-python

If you have poetry installed, you can also add pan-os-python to your project:

.. code-block:: shell

   poetry add pan-os-python

How to import
-------------

To use pan-os-python in a project:

.. code-block:: python

   import panos

You can also be more specific about which modules you want to import:

.. code-block:: python

   from panos import firewall
   from panos import network

A few examples
--------------

For configuration tasks, create a tree structure using the classes in
each module. Nodes hierarchy must follow the model in the
`Configuration Tree <http://pan-os-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configtree.html>`_.

The following examples assume the modules were imported as such:

.. code-block:: python

   from panos import firewall
   from panos import network

Create an interface and commit:

.. code-block:: python

   fw = firewall.Firewall("10.0.0.1", api_username="admin", api_password="admin")
   eth1 = network.EthernetInterface("ethernet1/1", mode="layer3")
   fw.add(eth1)
   eth1.create()
   fw.commit()

Operational commands leverage the 'op' method of the device:

.. code-block:: python

   fw = firewall.Firewall("10.0.0.1", api_username="admin", api_password="admin")
   print fw.op("show system info")

Some operational commands have methods to refresh the variables in an object:

.. code-block:: python

   # populates the version, serial, and model variables from the live device
   fw.refresh_system_info()

See more examples in the `Usage Guide <http://pan-os-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_.

Upgrade from pandevice
----------------------

This ``pan-os-python`` package is the evolution of the older ``pandevice`` package. To
upgrade from ``pandevice`` to ``pan-os-python``\ , follow these steps.


#. 
   Ensure you are using python3. `Python2 is
   end-of-life <https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/>`_ and not supported
   by ``pan-os-python``.

#. 
   Uninstall pandevice:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip uninstall pandevice
    # or
   poetry remove pandevice


#. Install pan-os-python:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip3 install pan-os-python
    # or
   poetry add pan-os-python


#. Change the import statements in your code from ``pandevice`` to ``panos``. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   import pandevice
   from pandevice.firewall import Firewall

    # would change to

   import panos
   from panos.firewall import Firewall


#. 
   Test your script or application

   There are no known breaking changes
   between ``pandevice v0.14.0`` and ``pan-os-python v1.0.0``\ , but it is a major
   upgrade so please verify everything works as expected.
