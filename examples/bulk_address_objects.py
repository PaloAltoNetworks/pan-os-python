bulk_address_objects.py
==========================

Use bulk operations to create / delete hundreds of firewall Address Objects.

NOTE: Please update the hostname and auth credentials variables
      before running.

This script will create a large number of address objects on the firewall
and then delete them.  The intent is to show how to use the new bulk
operations available in pan-os-python, both how to properly use them and what
to be careful of.

    # update of the address objects we just created, we need to make sure that
    # our object tree contains the address objects that existed before this
    # script started.  So let's add in the pre-existing address objects to

    # we invoke this on any of the related children in our pan-os-python

    # the pre-existing address objects in its tree, we won't accidentally
    # truncate them from the firewall config.

    # object.
