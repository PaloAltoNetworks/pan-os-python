log_forwarding_profile.py
==========================

Ensure that all security rules have the same log forwarding profile assigned.

This script checks if any rules are missing the specified log forwarding profile
and applies the profile if it is missing. This is done with as few API calls as
possible.

Environment variables required:
  PAN_HOSTNAME: The hostname or IP of the Firewall
  PAN_USERNAME: The username of a firewall admin
  PAN_PASSWORD: The password of a firewall admin
  PAN_LOG_PROFILE: The name of the log forwarding profile to apply

"""

    # Create a connection to a firewall and a rulebase to work inside

    # At this point, we've added SecurityRule objects to the Firewall
    # for each rule that doesn't have the right log forwarding profile.
    # The next step is to push all that configuration to the live device
    # at once using the 'create_similar()' method.

    # This takes the first SecurityRule to change and calls 'create_similar()'.
    # When 'create_similar()' is called, all the SecurityRules are pushed
    # to the firewall at once. The method is additive, so the existing security
    # rules will not change, except for the 'log_setting' parameter which
    # contains the log forwarding profile name.
